# TASKFORCE-CHALLENGES
- this project  contains three task challenges one folder includes the challenges of building an  `Interactive Photo Gallery`
using pure HTML, CSS and javascript  and the folder called `challenges` contains two files  
second and third challenges where the second is `ArrayMap.js`   and the other is `StingTransform.js`

##  The task of Building an Interactive Photo Gallery

- this task I created by referring to the figma that is provided and I designed 
  using pure HTML, CSS, javascript. 

## first html components
-in HTML contains the 4 images and the texts to each image that show the names of the animal image and their location country

## second styles.css 
-by styling the image I refer to how an image is styled on Figma provided 
and try to resize it by changing colour opacity and aligning it to the centre on that appear on browser pages like `chrome`, `edge`, `firefox` or `safaris`
- I make the hidden text when the screen is in small size and text visible on a large screen
- on the responsiveness i use the `media queries` css `max-width`.


## Implementing interactive and functionalities with `javascript`

-the third is to make an interactive to the images ,  I add a hover functionality where the mouseover each image the opacity changes and the image becomes enlarge 
and when mouse move out the image the image become to small as styled browsing pages 

- i write the `comments` description  to javascript 

THAT represent lines of code used to make image iteractive when mouse is over the image and when mouse is move out the image it change the size both `small screen` and `large screen`.



## the task for coding challenges

1. `Array Manipulation`
- second challenges is to code `Array Manipulation` where i create javascript files called `arrayMap.js`here i refer to the example of task provided where
- and i create a function called SubarrayWithSum includes the parameter string named `array` and  `targetValue` 
- the inputed array value the sum up to target on the exist cotinguos subarrays it returns true other wise return false.

2. `String Transformation`

-third coding chalenges is to code  `String Transformation` where i develop a program that display the following rules with if condition
● If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
● If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
● If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform
both operations in the order specified above.

- i refer to the example provided and i do it where as the rules seems and i write the comment on each line to explain how program works

## how  run coding challengs 
- to run javascript challenge we can use  cmmand terminal when there is nodejs installed in any pc we can use command `node space (filename.js)`
- ex: `node arrayMap.js` and press enter .
